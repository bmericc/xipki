Due to the license restrictions I cannot provide the JDBC drivers of MySQL, Oracle and DB2.
Please copy them to this directory.

1. Oracle
  Driver: ojdbc7.jar
  Download URL: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html

2. DB2
  Driver: db2jcc4.jar

3. MySQL/MariaDB

  You can access MySQL and MariaDB via both MariaDB and MySQL connector. The MariaDB connector library is
  delivered, and the MySQL connector library can be retrieved as follows:

  - For debian
  Use the mysql-connector-java.jar from the package libmysql-java:
    /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar

  - For non-debian
  Driver: mysql-connector-java.jar
  Download URL: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j
