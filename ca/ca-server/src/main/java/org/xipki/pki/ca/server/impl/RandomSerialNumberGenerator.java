/**
 * Copied from EJBCA.
 *
 * Implements a singleton serial number generator using SecureRandom. This
 * generator generates random 8 octec (64 bits) serial numbers.
 *
 * RFC3280 defines serialNumber be positive INTEGER, and X.690 defines INTEGER
 * consist of one or more octets. X.690 also defines as follows:
 *
 * If the contents octets of an integer value encoding consist of more than one
 * octet, then the bits of the first octet and bit 8 of the second octet: a)
 * shall not all be ones; and b) shall not all be zero.
 *
 * Therefore, minimum 8 octets value is 0080000000000000 and maximum value is
 * 7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF."
 *
 * Therefore, minimum 4 octets value is 00800000 and maximum value is 7FFFFFFF."
 *
 * X.690:
 *
 * 8.3 Encoding of an integer value
 * 8.3.1 The encoding of an integer value shall be primitive. The contents octets
 *  shall consist of one or more octets.
 * 8.3.2 If the contents octets of an integer value encoding consist of more than
 *  one octet, then the bits of the first octet
 * and bit 8 of the second octet:
 * a) shall not all be ones; and
 * b) shall not all be zero.
 * NOTE - These rules ensure that an integer value is always encoded in the smallest
 *  possible number of octets.
 * 8.3.3 The contents octets shall be a two's complement binary number equal to the
 *  integer value, and consisting of
 * bits 8 to 1 of the first octet, followed by bits 8 to 1 of the second octet,
 *  followed by bits 8 to 1 of each octet in turn up to
 * and including the last octet of the contents octets.
 * NOTE - The value of a two's complement binary number is derived by numbering the
 *  bits in the contents octets, starting with bit
 * 1 of the last octet as bit zero and ending the numbering with bit 8 of the first
 *  octet. Each bit is assigned a numerical value of 2N,
 * where N is its position in the above numbering sequence. The value of the two's
 *  complement binary number is obtained by
 * summing the numerical values assigned to each bit for those bits which are set to
 *  one, excluding bit 8 of the first octet, and then
 * reducing this value by the numerical value assigned to bit 8 of the first octet
 *  if that bit is set to one.
